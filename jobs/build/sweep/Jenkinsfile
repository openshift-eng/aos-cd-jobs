        <h2>Sweep bugs</h2>
        <b>Timing</b>: This runs after component builds (ocp3/ocp4/custom jobs),
        or when preparing a nightly for examination by QE.

        After component builds, bugs are queried that are in MODIFIED state,
        and are set to ON_QA. This is the signal to QE that they can test the bug.
        In this mode of operation, ATTACH_BUGS is false.

        When preparing a set of nightlies and advisories for QE, the sweep job will
        look for all bugs that are in ON_QA or VERIFIED state, and attach them
        to the default advisories, according to those recorded in ocp-build-data
        group.yml.
        For 3.11, all bugs are swept into the rpm advisory.
        For 4.y, bugs are swept into the image or extras advisory.
        CVEs are not currently swept by this job.

        Optionally, builds from our brew candidate tags may also be swept. If necessary,
        the advisory will be first set to NEW_FILES.
