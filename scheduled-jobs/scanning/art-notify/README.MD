This job will periodically scan a Slack workspace for messages with the ::art-attention::
emoji and WITHOUT the ::art-attention-resolved:: . It will then send a notification to
the team-art channel.

Artists should add the ::art-attention:: emoji so that release-artists can't forget about it
during handoffs. When a thread is resolved, the ::art-attention-resolved:: emoji to the 
message which had attention.
